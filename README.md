Perceptron Classifier in C++

This repository provides a simple yet complete implementation of a Perceptron, one of the most fundamental tools in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. Written entirely in C++, it walks through every step — from reading data to training the model and evaluating its accuracy.

 Purpose : 
The goal of this project is to understand how linear classifiers like Perceptrons operate under the hood — covering:

- Data loading from CSV files
- Vectorized training using the perceptron learning rule
- Binary prediction using learned weights and bias
- Accuracy calculation and model evaluation
- This hands-on approach helps reinforce key AI/ML concepts by implementing them from scratch.

  Part of a University Project for the  AI LAB. 

Build & Run : 
g++ -o perceptron main.cpp
./perceptron

CSV Format
Each row in the CSV should follow the format:

feature1,feature2,...,featureN,label
